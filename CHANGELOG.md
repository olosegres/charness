# Changelog

## 3.0.0 — 2026-10-07

**Published as `charness`.** The npm package is renamed from `telegramcode` to
`charness`, after the project. To move over:
`npm uninstall -g telegramcode && npm install -g charness`. The `telegramcode`
command, the `~/.config/telegramcode` config, the `~/.telegramCode` data dir and
the `TELEGRAMCODE_*` variables stay as they were, so an existing setup carries
over unchanged; `charness` is a new alias of the command.

### Added
- **Requests and answers.** A message, a voice note or a scheduled run opens a
  request; the agent answers it with the `answer_request` tool (progress,
  question or final), and every answer is pinned in the topic (only the latest
  stays pinned). An agent that ends its turn without answering is woken, and
  the operator is alerted when waking gives up. A usage-limit stop answers the
  open request.
- **`/verbosity` views**: Stream only, Stream + answers, Answers only. In
  Answers only, an agent that keeps writing after its final answer is reminded
  to send whatever matters.
- **Sleeping Claude conversations.** An idle json-stream conversation is
  compacted and its process stopped; the next message resumes it. A third
  Claude backend, per-turn, stops the process after every turn.
- **Compaction**: `/compact` on every agent backend, compaction on idle, the
  agent's own `compact_conversation` tool, and the summary posted to the topic
  on request (`/compact_summary`, off by default). Every compaction summary
  names the skills to load again.
- **Usage limits**: wait for the reset and resume by itself
  (`/auto_continue_limits`).
- **`/reminders`**: reminders the bot posts and pins itself, without an agent.
- **Watchdog checks**: `schedule_create` with a `checkCommand` runs a check on
  schedule and wakes the agent on the first failure.
- **`/timezone`**: one instance-wide time zone for schedules and timestamps.
- **`/model`**: a two-level picker with pages and per-provider disabling;
  the model and effort are shown when an agent starts or switches.
- **OpenCode `/connect`** works with ordinary providers.
- **Replies**: the replied-to message goes into the agent's prompt, and a
  replied-to photo, file or voice note is named with the bot's saved copy.
- **Voice**: transcription is retried after a timeout or a transient error.
- **`send_messages_to_user`**: each message may carry a file.
- **Jira Cloud connector** (`CONNECTORS=jira`): an issue assigned to the AI
  account becomes a request in its own session, and the answers come back as
  comments.
- **Docker**: the whole bot runs in one container (`docker/`).

### Fixed
- Many fixes in output streaming, session restore after a restart, OpenCode
  event routing and the Claude screen scrape; see the git history.

## Earlier changes, shipped in the 2.0.x packages

### Changed
- **`WORK_DIR` is no longer fatal.** Launch `telegramcode` from the parent
  folder containing your projects — that `$PWD` becomes the work root.
  `WORK_ROOT` is now an advanced override (services / containers where the
  process cwd can't be controlled); a stray legacy `WORK_DIR` is ignored, not a
  startup error.
- **`ALLOWED_GROUP_ID` is now optional.** Leave it empty to auto-pair with the
  first forum supergroup an admin contacts the bot from; set it only to pin a
  specific group before first contact.
- **OpenCode no longer interrupts a running turn for a new prompt.** A prompt
  sent while OpenCode is busy is queued by `prompt_async` and picked up promptly
  instead of aborting the live turn (which only lost work). Claude keeps its
  Escape-and-wait — its TUI ignores typed input mid-turn.
- **Bot UI language is resolved per Telegram chat.** A `/language` override wins,
  otherwise the bot uses Telegram `language_code`, then the last seen chat
  locale, then English; the old global env language knob is removed.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-05-13

**Audit fixes release.** Full repo audit (50 findings across security,
concurrency, resource handling, error contracts, infra) closed in 20
focused commits. See `agent/tasks/actual/2026-05-13-audit-fixes.md` for
the full plan; highlights below.

### Security
- **Two RCEs closed** in `claudeCliAdapter`: `sendInput` and
  `startSession`/`resumeSession` built tmux command lines via
  `execSync` with `JSON.stringify`-interpolated user input, letting any
  allowed user run arbitrary host commands via `$(…)` / backticks in a
  thread message. Reroute all tmux calls onto the argv-based helper;
  single-quote every element of the final `tmux new-session` shell
  command (S1).
- **Forum-topic auth bypass** closed: `forum_topic_created` /
  `_closed` / `_reopened` are now gated on `ALLOWED_USERS`, not just
  the chat allowlist. A non-allowed admin previously could rename a
  topic to fuzzy-match a sensitive WORK_ROOT subdir and have the next
  allowed-user message launch an agent there (S2).
- **OpenCode SSE cross-thread events**: `permission.asked` and
  `question.asked` events without `sessionID` used to fan out to every
  active thread, auto-approving permissions and stacking duplicate
  questions. Now any event without a `sessionID` is dropped (S5).
- **SSRF guard** on `OPENCODE_URL` (loopback by default, opt in with
  `OPENCODE_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`); 30 s timeout on every fetch; abortable
  SSE reader; 10-minute wall-clock cap on SSE reconnect (S7).
- **Docker hardening**: drop `user: root`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`,
  `security_opt: no-new-privileges`, bounded `mem_limit`/`pids_limit`,
  healthcheck. `.docker-entrypoint.sh` uses `runuser -- "$@"` instead
  of `su -c "$*"` so argv stays argv. claude-code install moved to
  build time with a pinned version (S16).

### Bugs
- `resume_<idx>` callback: full session id is recovered from a
  per-thread map instead of being truncated into callback_data, which
  used to make OpenCode resume target a non-existent id (S4).
- Pinned-banner pipeline serialised per key so concurrent adapter
  events can't stack duplicate pinned messages (S6).
- OpenCode lifecycle: per-key serialisation of start/stop, cleanup of
  `statusDebounceTimer` and `reconnectTimer` on stop, explicit
  teardown of every session after `restartServer` (S8).
- Claude adapter: auto-Enter / auto-Accept timers tracked + cleared on
  stop; `pollOutput` uses self-rescheduling `setTimeout` with
  re-entrancy guard; `adoptExistingTmuxSession` rejects zombie panes
  with no live child; capture-pane scrollback raised to 2000 lines (S9).
- `/clear` snapshots message ids under `state.withLock` so agent
  messages pushed mid-deletion can't slip out of tracking (S11).
- `/output` flips `markNeedsNewMessage` and surfaces "+N more chunks
  omitted" instead of silently dropping (S11).
- `/new` routes through `applyBinding` so collision warnings reach the
  new thread (S11).
- `switchThreadAdapter` clears the previous adapter's stored session id
  so post-restart reattach doesn't pick the wrong adapter (S12).
- In-memory per-thread maps GC'd against `state.json` every 60 s so
  orphan entries from UI-deleted topics don't linger (S13).
- Numeric model-selection reply unconditionally returns; previously
  fell through to NL-start + agent-forward when `setModel` was absent
  (S12).
- `downloadFile` capped at 5 redirects with 20 s `setTimeout`;
  `transcribeAudio` got the same timeout and a proper error handler
  installed before `form.pipe(req)`. Voice file URL now built via
  `ctx.telegram.getFileLink` so the bot token isn't materialised in a
  JS string (S14).

### Contracts
- `AgentAdapter` events documented: `startSession` throws on failure,
  `error` is for async failures after a successful start, `closed` is
  unsolicited death, `stopped` is explicit teardown. Claude's two
  start paths now throw + clean up. `setModel` unified to
  `Promise<string | null>`. OpenCode SSE giveup emits `closed` so the
  bot wipes persisted ids (S10).

### Hygiene
- `tsconfig.json`: `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`,
  `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noImplicitOverride`,
  `exclude: src/__tests__/**`.
- `package.json`: drop `ts-node`, move `typescript` to devDeps,
  `private: true`, `engines.node >=22`.
- `BOT_LANG` lowercased + trimmed with a warn on unknown values.
- 19 hardcoded English `ctx.answerCbQuery` strings migrated to a new
  `cb.*` namespace in i18n.
- `.env.example` no longer leaks the author's home path; the two-
  instance example uses `REPLACE_ME` so a copy-pasted file fails
  validation visibly.
- DATA_DIR resolved via `resolveDataDir()` everywhere; previously the
  two adapters dropped state files in `$HOME` instead of `DATA_DIR`,
  breaking two-instance isolation (S3).

### Tests
- 13 new tests: i18n placeholders + fallback (S19/#50), agent NL
  trigger parser extracted into `src/agentTrigger.ts` with full ru/en
  coverage (S19/#25), state.json forward-compat round-trip with an
  unknown future field. 98 tests passing (R9/R10 still skipped).

### Deferred
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in `tsconfig.json` (106 errors fallout —
  needs a careful per-site task).
- Complete MarkdownV2 escaper (regression risk).
- bot.ts test coverage (3300 LOC — separate task).

## 2.0.0 — 2026-05-12

**Breaking release.** The bot now routes through a Telegram forum
supergroup with one topic per task; the 1.x "one bot = one private chat
= one folder" mode is removed. See [Migration](README.md#migration-from-1x).

### Added
- **Forum-supergroup routing.** `ThreadKey = (chatId, threadId)` is the
  routing key everywhere; threads are bound to subfolders of `WORK_ROOT`
  and run their own `claude` or `opencode` session in parallel.
- **Persistent state** (`src/state.ts`) — `${DATA_DIR}/state.json` with
  atomic writes (write tmp → fsync fd → rename → fsync parent dir),
  per-key async-lock for concurrent `/bind`, corrupted-file archival to
  `state.json.corrupted-<ts>` with a fresh restart, debounced saves with
  immediate flush on critical paths.
- **Restart-safe sessions** — claude tmux sessions named
  `claude-${chatId}-${threadId}` are re-adopted on boot via
  `tmux ls`; opencode SSE streams are reopened from persisted
  `opencodeSessionId`. Orphan tmux sessions are killed.
- **Per-thread Claude session id** — `crypto.randomUUID()` →
  `claude --session-id <uuid>` on a fresh start, `--resume <uuid>` on
  resume. Fixes the 1.x picker hang.
- **MCP hierarchy** — user (`~/.claude/settings.json`) /
  group (`${DATA_DIR}/mcp.json`) /
  project (`${workDir}/.mcp.json`) /
  thread (`${DATA_DIR}/threads/<key>.json`). `${VAR}` placeholders are
  expanded by the bot before claude sees the config; tmp files are
  written `0600` and cleaned up on `stopSession`.
- **Commands.** `/bind`, `/unbind`, `/where` (per topic);
  `/ls`, `/list`, `/new`, `/status` (global), `/doctor`, `/mcp`,
  `/whoami`, `/version`, context-aware `/help`, `/stop-all`.
- **Path traversal protection** — NFC normalisation, control-char
  rejection, `realpathSync` + strict containment, symlink-out rejection,
  `/bind .` rejection.
- **Auto-welcome** when the bot is added to a forum supergroup, and
  rich post-bind welcome with CLAUDE.md / .mcp.json / git stats.
- **Token-bucket rate limiter** — 1 token/sec per chat, burst 5,
  layered with reactive 429-retry. Prevents the multi-thread N-msg/sec
  storm that would otherwise breach Telegram's per-chat budget.
- **i18n** — `BOT_LANG=ru|en` (default ru) via `src/i18n.ts`.
- **Two-instance docker-compose** (`examples/docker-compose.yml`) — pet
  + work, isolated `DATA_DIR`, group, token, `OPENCODE_URL` port.
- **Test suite** — `yarn test` (node:test + tsx). 54 tests cover R1
  (ThreadKey round-trip), R2 (gating matrix), R3 (path-traversal
  corpus), R4 (legacy file migration), R5 (concurrent state writes),
  R6 (corrupted state archival), R7 (rate-limit token bucket + 429
  retry), R8 (send-error classification).

### Changed
- **`WORK_DIR` → `WORK_ROOT`.** `WORK_DIR` is now fatal — bot fails to
  start with a migration hint. `WORK_ROOT` points at the *parent* folder
  containing your projects.
- **`ALLOWED_GROUP_ID` is required.** Without it the bot has no idea
  which forum supergroup to listen to.
- **`DATA_DIR`** — single-instance default `~/.telegramCode`, mandatory
  for two-instance setups.
- **`--dangerously-skip-permissions`** hardcoded for symmetry with
  opencode's auto-approve.
- **`/clear`** scoped to the current thread (uses persisted message ids),
  chunked at 100 per call, surfaces the Telegram 48 h limit.
- **README** rewritten end-to-end around forum supergroup setup,
  troubleshooting, MCP hierarchy, two-instance compose, migration.

### Removed
- One-bot-per-private-chat mode and `WORK_DIR` env var.
- Legacy `~/.telegram-bot-messages.json` (renamed to `.bak` on first
  start; no message-id migration into the new schema).

### Deferred (Phase 9+)
- `/mcp-add`, `/mcp-remove`, `/mcp-restart` UI commands.
- OpenCode per-thread MCP override.
- Routines / opencode-scheduler integration (`/schedule`,
  `/schedule-cloud`) — Phase 8.
- Claude Code hooks integration + `--input-format stream-json`
  rewrite — Phase 9.

### Stage 7 polish (shipped 2026-05-12)
- Per-thread pinned status banner (`📁 subdir · agent · model ·
  state`) — edits in place on every adapter lifecycle event,
  unpinned on `/unbind`.
- Fuzzy auto-bind on `forum_topic_created` — separator drift
  (`my-api` ↔ `my_api` ↔ `my api`) is folded alongside case + NFC.
- `/bind` keyboard pagination at 20 folders/page with
  `[⬅️ Prev] [N/M] [Next ➡️]` nav row; `WORK_ROOT` listing cap
  raised 50 → 200.
- R9 (tmux re-attach) and R10 (claude `--resume` on bogus UUID)
  filed as documented skip-tests pending an integration harness.

### Migration
1. Stop the 1.x bot.
2. Create a forum supergroup, add the bot, follow
   [README Quick Start](README.md#2-create-the-forum-supergroup).
3. Rename `WORK_DIR` → `WORK_ROOT` and point at the parent folder.
4. Add `ALLOWED_GROUP_ID` (find it via `/whoami` in the group).
5. Set `DATA_DIR` if you run multiple instances on one host.
6. `docker compose up -d`.

The legacy `~/.telegram-bot-messages.json` is moved to `.bak` on first
start; message-id history does not migrate.
