/**
 * @description Invert a directory (an OpenCode instance's absolute working
 * folder) to the serialized thread keys bound to it. The scheduler MCP server's
 * `dir:<directory>` scope (S5) needs this to resolve which threads a directory
 * token may touch; `bot.ts` has the forward `binding → workDir` mapping
 * (`resolveBoundWorkDir`) but no inverse, so this is the single place that walks
 * every binding and matches its RESOLVED workDir against `directory`.
 *
 * Why resolved workDir and not the raw `subdir`: the OpenCode injection (S6)
 * scopes the token to the canonical agent workdir. Comparing against the raw
 * relative `subdir`, or an unresolved `WORK_ROOT`, would miss symlinked roots.
