/**
 * @description Scheduler delivery (plan S4): the real `deliver(job, fireContext)`
 * callback the engine (S3) invokes at fire time. The flow is locked by the plan:
 *
 *   1. announce — post a visible message into the topic (job name + human
 *      schedule text + the prompt; a "missed at HH:MM" note for a catch-up run).
 *   2. pin      — pin that announcement (silent ONLY when the job opted in;
 *      default notifies all members). A pin failure degrades to a `console.warn`
 *      and the flow continues — the announcement is already visible.
 *   3. ensure session — if the thread's agent is active but BUSY, poll its busy
 *      probe every {@link busyPollIntervalMs} up to {@link waitIdleTimeoutMs}
 *      (do NOT interrupt live work), then forward (forwarding interrupts only as
 *      the timeout fallback — existing `forwardPromptToAgent` semantics). If no
 *      session, start one (with the job's `lastAdapterName` snapshot as the
 *      adapter fallback — a topic that never picked an agent and carries no
 *      snapshot fails with `no agent selected`). An unbound topic → outcome
 *      `failed` with a distinct error string the engine records (S8 turns that
 *      into a pause).
 *   4. forward — hand the prefixed prompt to the agent.
 *
 * A REMINDER record (`deliveryKind: 'reminder'`) stops after step 2: its whole
 * delivery IS the announcement plus its pin, which is what pierces a muted topic.
 * Steps 3–4 are skipped entirely, so a reminder fires in an unbound topic and in
 * General — there is no session to ensure, nothing to interrupt, and no agent to
 * tell about the run.
 *
 * It owns NO bot.ts import: every side effect is injected via
 * {@link ScheduleDeliveryDeps} (announce / pin / busy probe / ensure-session /
 * forward / clock / sleep), so bot.ts wires its existing functions in with thin
 * lambdas (S8) and the wait-loop is unit-testable on a fake clock.
