   * "Press Enter to continue" gate and the bypass-permissions warning — by
   * issuing the matching keystrokes. Extracted from {@link pollOutput} so the
   * resume-seeding path (which suppresses conversation TEXT) can still drive
   * these prompts; suppression must hide chatter, not the lifecycle.
   *
   * Also the detection seam for a terminal provider error / logged-out row
   * ({@link getClaudeAgentErrorLine}: `API Error: …`, `⎿ … · API Error: …`, or
   * `⎿ … Please run /login`): when it first classifies, emit one `apiError`
   * event — the trigger for the auto-retry (transient / usageLimit) OR the
   * surfaced logged-out notice (auth). Detection scans the NEW pane delta only
   * (never the full pane / arbitrary conversation text), so a recognized error
   * row fires exactly once — when it first renders.
   *
   * A large new chunk (`newPart.length > 50`) means real conversation moved on,
   * so the one-shot `handled*` guards are reset to re-arm for a later prompt.
