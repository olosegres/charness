/**
 * @description Pure planning logic for flushing agent `output` to Telegram —
 * extracted from `bot.ts` so the streaming-append decision is unit-testable
 * without booting Telegraf.
 *
 * Live repro 2026-06-05 (topic "overview app 1"): OpenCode emits a long reply
 * as incremental tails, and the bot edited the SAME message with only the
 * newest batch each flush — every edit replaced everything before it, so the
 * user could read only the last tail. The fix: a continuation tail is
 * appended to the text already rendered into the last message and the FULL
 * combined text is re-rendered (also re-pairing markdown tokens that straddle
 * two flushes), spilling into new messages when it outgrows the Telegram cap.

/**
 * @description The effective continuation flag the GROUP output path should use

 *
 * OpenCode marks every tail except a response's first with `meta.isContinuation`,
 * so the group edit-in-place path already knows which outputs extend the last
 * message; for it (`outputsDeltas === false`) the meta flag passes through
 * unchanged. The Claude scrape adapter emits each poll's prose delta with NO
 * meta even though every delta CONTINUES the same block — treating those as
 * non-continuations made `getOutputFlushPlan` start a new message per poll flush
 * (the one-message-per-scrape flood, and every re-flowed table width its own
 * message).
 *
 * For a delta-emitting adapter a poll delta is therefore a CONTINUATION (it
 * edits the growing message in place) UNLESS the pane had a real block boundary
 * before it — a blank-line paragraph break or a distinct block (a settled
 * table), both surfaced out-of-band as `startsNewParagraph`. At such a boundary
 * the delta starts a NEW message (the locked boundary rule: a new message begins
 * only at a paragraph/section, a distinct block, or a fresh turn — the last via
 * `needsNewMessage`, which `getOutputFlushPlan` already honours). Unlike the DM
 * cursor (one accumulating draft → everything is a continuation,
 * {@link getDmDraftContinuation}), group renders discrete messages, so a
 * paragraph/block boundary must break the message, not glue onto it.
