/**
 * @description Pure boundary/finalize decision for the DM-mode draft "cursor"
 * (DM streaming v2). The bot keeps ONE accumulating draft holding the full
 * current reply text and FINALIZES it into a permanent `sendMessage` on a
 * boundary; after a finalize the next output starts a fresh draft → a new
 * message.
 *
 * This module decides WHICH boundary (if any) a given feed / idle tick hits; the
 * `bot.ts` draft manager owns the real timers and the Telegram IO (rendering,
 * `splitMessage`, `sendMessageDraft`, `replyToThread`). Keeping the decision
 * pure lets a timeline test with an injectable clock prove the gates fire
 * (mirrors `draftPacer.test.ts`).
 *
 * The boundaries (locked in the plan):
 *  - new-response — a non-continuation output (or a forced new-message break)
 *    arriving while a draft is already active: finalize the previous draft, then
 *    start a fresh one for this output;
 *  - overflow — the prospective accumulated text would render past the Telegram
 *    cap: finalize the full chunk(s) and continue the remainder in a new draft;
 *  - isFinal — the turn's last frame: finalize and do not reopen a draft;
 *  - idle — no new output for {@link FINALIZE_IDLE_MS}: finalize the snapshot;
 *  - append — none of the above: just grow the draft and pace it.

 * @description The effective continuation flag the DM draft cursor should use

 * which outputs accumulate into the live draft. The Claude scrape adapter emits
 * each poll's delta with NO meta — `metaIsContinuation` is always false — even
 * though every delta is the SAME answer continuing. Treating those as
 * non-continuations would hit the new-response boundary on every poll
 * (`getDraftFeedAction` → `finalizeThenStart`) and flood the topic with one tiny
 * message per delta.
 *
 * For a delta-emitting adapter the answer therefore accumulates as a
 * continuation; the real turn boundaries are driven separately by
 * `needsNewMessage` (a new prompt, or the answer→tool transition the bot marks
 * when output resumes after a status frame), the idle timer, overflow, and
 * isFinal — exactly the boundary set `getDraftFeedAction` already honours. For a
 * continuation-marking adapter the meta flag is authoritative and passes through
 * unchanged.
