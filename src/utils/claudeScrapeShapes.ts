 * active task title there ("Fixing streaming output overwrite…"), and
 * the single-token `\S+…` let those ticks leak into permanent messages
 * (adapter side) / flood the topic (bot side). Since 2026-06-11 both

 * ("Fixing relations add flow (sub-agent)…", the live topic flood), and
 * a task title can carry its own parens. The trailing end-anchored
 * `(<elapsed>[ · …])` parenthesis stays the load-bearing anchor — the

 *   - line must END with `for \d+(?:m\s+\d+)?s` — a time literal,
 *     not a generic noun;
 *   - line has no other content (anchored `$`).
 * `\S+` is the minimal relaxation: one non-whitespace token between
 * the glyph and ` for `. Accepts `Sautéed`, `Churned`, future verbs,
