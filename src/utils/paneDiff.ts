 * TUI redraws the whole pane every poll, so a positional diff would re-emit
 * everything that scrolled).
 *
 * Blank lines are NOT part of the matched set (they aren't unique), but a
 * single blank that sat BETWEEN two runs of new content is preserved as a
 * paragraph separator: the previous implementation `continue`d past every
 * empty line, so multi-paragraph answers arrived in Telegram with every
 * paragraph glued to the next (the `cleanOutput` C1 fix only kept blanks in
 * the FULL pane; this delta path still dropped them). An INTERIOR blank (within
 * this chunk) is kept inline in `text`; a LEADING blank (before the chunk's
 * first new line) is instead reported via `startsNewParagraph` so the separator
 * survives the pipeline's trims and is rebuilt only at the append join.
 *
 * Suppression is by SET membership, not multiset count (B10): a line that
 * appeared in `oldContent` at all is suppressed for EVERY occurrence in
 * `newContent`, not just the first `oldCount` of them. Why: typing a draft
 * that wraps to several rows grows Claude's input box; the viewport is fixed
 * height, so the transcript scrolls and tmux re-renders the lines straddling
 * the scrollback↔visible boundary twice in one capture. The old multiset diff
 * suppressed only as many copies as `oldContent` held, so the extra copy of an
 * already-sent answer line counted as new and was re-emitted (a chunk of the
 * previous answer reappeared before the next turn). Set membership errs toward
 * DROPPING such a re-render duplicate — the locked tradeoff, since a re-send is
 * the user-visible bug while a genuinely-new line that merely repeats an
 * earlier transcript line is a rare, low-cost loss. (Note: `lastContent`
 * advances to the full pane on every change in `pollOutput`, NOT only on emit,
 * so a suppressed line does NOT self-heal next poll — hence we suppress only
 * lines that were truly already present.)
 *
 * Exported + pure so the diff is unit-testable without booting tmux.
