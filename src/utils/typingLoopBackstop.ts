/**
 * @description Loop-level backstop for the native "agent is typing…" indicator —
 * a bounded safety net that force-stops the typing loader when it is being kept
 * alive by a PROVABLY-INCONSISTENT state, never by a legitimately long turn.
 *
 * ROOT-CAUSE CONTEXT. The typing loop self-stops only when
 * `checkShouldKeepTyping` (`isOutputStreaming || isAdapterBusy`) goes false, and
 * has NO absolute bound. `jsonStreamBusyWatchdog` already covers a stuck
 * `isBusy` (a missed terminal `result`). This backstop covers the OTHER input:
 * `isOutputStreaming`, which reads `q.pendingOutput !== null || q.isProcessing ||
 * q.debounceTimer !== null`. A leaked non-null `debounceTimer` (the `isFinal`
 * fast-path in `queueOutput` cleared the timer but left the handle set) pins
 * `isOutputStreaming` true forever → the indicator hangs unbounded even though
 * the output queue is empty (live 2026-07-19, a json-stream group topic firing
 * `sendChatAction('typing')` every 4s for an hour+ after a clean turn end).
 *
 * WHY THIS CAN'T CUT A LEGIT LONG (SILENT) TURN. The backstop fires ONLY on a
 * contradiction that a working agent can never produce:
 *  - a genuinely-working agent keeps `isAdapterBusy` TRUE (a long silent
 *    Bash/Task tool, a sub-agent, an unanswered question all hold busy) → vetoed;
 *  - a bot-issued compaction (`isCompacting`) is work the bot is itself awaiting,
 *    and on OpenCode it sets no busy flag at all → vetoed;
 *  - a live DM draft is a real stream (`isTransportStreaming`) → vetoed;
 *  - real text waiting to send (`hasPendingOutput`) or an in-flight send
 *    (`isProcessing`, which may legitimately be a slow API call) → vetoed.
 * Only when the adapter is idle, nothing is drafting, the queue is empty AND an
 * un-fired debounce handle lingers does it fire. A LIVE debounce is ALWAYS armed
 * WITH pending text (both `queueOutput` and `processOutputQueue` arm it only when
 * `pendingOutput` is set, nulling it the instant it fires), so "debounce armed +
 * empty queue" can only be the dead/stale handle from the leak — never a real
 * in-flight turn. The decision is therefore safe by construction: it truncates a
 * leak, never work.
