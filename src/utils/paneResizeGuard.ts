/**
 * @description Pure decision logic for the Claude scrape pane-RESIZE guard.
 *
 * WHY it exists (live incident 2026-07-02): an interactive
 * `tmux attach` from a normal-width terminal resizes the tmux window to the
 * client's size (and back to the `-x/-y` default on detach). tmux re-wraps the
 * WHOLE scrollback at the new width, so every physical line becomes a
 * different string: the per-poll line-SET diff (`getNewPaneContent`) sees
 * ~everything as "new" (69k-char diffs), and the long-horizon relay window
 * can't match re-wrapped lines either — its 16-char minimum deliberately
 * exempts short lines, so clusters of short old lines (JSON fragments, code
 * snippets, list numbers) leaked into the topic as ragged messages on EVERY
 * width flap, and captures taken mid-repaint leaked broken ANSI prefixes as
 * status frames.
 *
 * The guard: the poll loop queries `#{pane_width}x#{pane_height}` AFTER each
 * capture (same-poll order matters — a resize landing between the two calls is
 * then detected on THIS poll, never after the giant diff already shipped). On
 * a size change it emits NOTHING and re-seeds the diff baseline from the fresh
 * capture, then stays in a short "settling" mode until a poll sees the capture
 * unchanged (the TUI's own SIGWINCH repaint may lag tmux's mechanical re-wrap
 * by a poll or two). {@link resizeSettleMaxPolls} caps the mode so a busy,
 * constantly-streaming pane can never be wedged into permanent silence —
 * same shape as the resume-seeding cap.
 *
 * Locked tradeoff (same direction as `getNewPaneContent` and
 * `recentRelayWindow`): err toward DROPPING output. Real output produced
 * during the few settling polls is swallowed with the repaint; a resize flood
 * is the user-visible bug, a ~1-2s hole in a streamed answer mid-resize is a
 * low-cost loss.
