/**
 * @description Pure decision for the GROUP output transport's `finalizeInFlight`
 * (S2): given the thread's coalesced output-queue state at a settle/teardown
 * boundary, decide whether there is an unsent remainder to force-deliver (so the
 * agent's final answer is never discarded) or the turn is already fully
 * delivered (a no-op — no duplicate post).
 *
 * Extracted from `bot.ts`'s `finalizeGroupOutput` so the "remainder vs no-op"
 * + importance decision is unit-testable without the Telegraf / queue
 * machinery. The bot-side function owns the imperative drain (snapshot + null
 * the buffer, then `sendOutputImmediate`); this owns only the decision.
 *
 * The group queue already SEPARATES what landed from what is pending:
 * `lastMessageText` holds the last landed message and `pendingOutput` holds the
 * coalesced-but-unsent remainder. So the "reconcile final accumulated vs last
 * landed" reduces to: send `pendingOutput` if it is non-empty. No text diff is
 * needed — the queue is the single source of the remainder.
