/**
 * @description Rolling window of recently-RELAYED Claude pane lines — the

 *
 * WHY it exists (live incident 2026-06-10, plan
 * `agent/tasks/actual/2026-06-10-claude-stale-rescrape-dedup.md`): the
 * per-poll diff only knows the immediately-previous pane capture. When the
 * Claude TUI re-renders hours-old scrollback (full repaint, scroll-through,
 * resize), the redrawn lines are absent from that previous capture, so the
 * diff classifies them as "new" and re-relays them — chunked and overlapping
 * as the pane scrolls (a topic was flooded with ~12 chunks of a stale ~1400
 * line diff). This window remembers what was actually RELAYED to the topic,
 * so a re-render of already-sent content is suppressed regardless of WHAT
 * triggered the redraw.
 *
 * Locked tradeoff — the SAME direction as the per-poll set diff (see
 * `getNewPaneContent`'s JSDoc): err toward DROPPING a re-render duplicate. A
 * re-send flood is the user-visible bug; a rare suppressed legit repeat (e.g.
 * re-running an identical long command within the window horizon) is a
 * low-cost loss. Like `lastContent`, the window does not self-heal a
 * wrongly-suppressed line within its horizon. Two guards bound the damage:
 * only SUBSTANTIAL lines (≥ {@link relayDedupMinLineLength} after
 * normalization) are ever recorded or suppressed — short lines ("yes",
 * "done", list bullets) repeat legitimately all the time and always pass —
 * and the FIFO bound means old lines eventually evict as new content is
 * relayed.
