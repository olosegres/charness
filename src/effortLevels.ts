/**
 * @description Reasoning-effort level catalogs and per-backend helpers.
 *
 * The bot's `/effort` command and both adapters share this module so the
 * level vocabularies stay in one place and stay easy to unit-test.
 *
 * **Two vocabularies, on purpose.**
 *
 * - **Claude** has a native `/effort` slash command with a small fixed set
 *   (`low medium high xhigh max auto ultracode`). claude itself clamps an
 *   unsupported level for the current model down to the nearest supported
 *   one, so the bot offers the canonical set unconditionally — the adapter
 *   has no way to read claude's live model.
 * - **OpenCode** encodes reasoning effort as the `variants` map on a model
 *   in `provider.models.<m>.variants` (e.g. anthropic ships `high`/`max`,
 *   openai ships `none…xhigh`). The legal set therefore depends on which
 *   model the thread is currently using and cannot be hard-coded — the
 *   OpenCode adapter reads it live from `GET /config/providers` and applies
 *   the chosen variant per-prompt. See `openCodeAdapter.ts`.
