 * - 'toolResult' (key: SessionKey, payload: ToolResultEvent) — a completed tool call's output (OpenCode); the bot applies the per-thread tool-results {@link DisplayVerbosityMode}
 * - 'subagentStatus' (key: SessionKey, payload: SubagentStatusEvent) — OpenCode delegation lifecycle for `minimal`/`short` `/subagent` modes; the bot owns a dedicated self-updating status message with a ticking elapsed timer
 * - 'apiError' (key: SessionKey, error: AgentApiErrorClass) — provider-side API error at the proxy boundary (auto-retry trigger; only when {@link AgentApiErrorClass} classification matched)
 * - 'started'  (key: SessionKey)                  — session is up and ready
 * - 'stopped'  (key: SessionKey)                  — `stopSession` completed (explicit teardown)
 * - 'closed'   (key: SessionKey)                  — session died on its own (process exit, SSE giveup, server crash)
 * - 'error'    (key: SessionKey, error: Error)    — asynchronous failure AFTER successful startSession resolution
 *
 * Audit S10 / #16 contract clarifications (enforced by every adapter):
 *
 * - `startSession` / `resumeSession` rejects (throws) if the session
 *   could not be started or recovered. Successful resolution implies
 *   `checkIsActive(key) === true` and that subsequent events will fire.
 *
 * - `emit('error', …)` is for failures that happen AFTER a successful
 *   start (network blip, SSE drop with no recovery). Synchronous start
 *   failures must throw, never emit error+return.
 *
 * - `emit('closed', …)` is for unsolicited deaths only. If the user
 *   called `stopSession`, the adapter emits `stopped` instead. Both
 *   events MUST come with the same teardown (in-memory state freed).
