/**
 * Shared, side-effect-only boot-env shim for the suites that import `../bot`:
 * `reattachRecapPost`, `reconcileTransientFrames`, `routedCommandTrigger`,
 * `routedCommandDelivery`. (Named after its first consumer; kept rather than renamed so the import paths
 * stay stable.)
 *
 * `bot.ts` validates the boot environment at MODULE-IMPORT time (`parseEnv()`
 * runs as a top-level `const`, `process.exit(1)` on a missing `BOT_TOKEN`).
 * ESM import hoisting means a `process.env` assignment in the test body runs
 * AFTER `bot.ts` has already evaluated. Importing this module BEFORE the `bot`
 * import guarantees the env is set first (import order is preserved among
 * hoisted imports), so `parseEnv()` succeeds and the module's exported helpers
 * can be exercised in isolation.
 *
 * Matches neither the `*.test.ts` nor `*.e2e.ts` runner globs, so it is never
 * executed as a test itself.
