/**
 * @description Unit tests for `checkIsWedgedTurn` — the OpenCode "prompt
 * delivered but the agent never ran a turn" detector. This backs the fix for
 * the silent-hang bug (live 2026-08-15, the my-news digest schedule): a bloated
 * session accepted every prompt (HTTP 204) but its agent loop exited at step 0
 * with no assistant activity, so `session.idle` arrived with zero output and the
 * topic looked dead. Each guard is load-bearing: a false positive fires the
 * scary "session stuck" notice on a healthy turn, a false negative brings the
 * silent hang back.

/**
 * @description Unit tests for `checkIsReplacementTurnMissing` — the bound on how
 * long a post-provider-retry REPLACEMENT prompt may take to start its turn.
 *
 * `session.status` carries no turn identifier, so after aborting a stale
 * provider-managed retry the adapter waits for the next `busy` to mark the
 * replacement turn's start. A wedged session accepts the replacement (HTTP 204)
 * and never runs it, so that `busy` never arrives — the boundary latched
 * forever, the topic reported busy indefinitely, every later idle was swallowed,
 * and the wedged-turn detector stayed disarmed because this path defers arming
 * it to that same `busy`. Each guard is load-bearing: reporting when the turn
 * DID start restarts a healthy conversation, and not reporting restores the
 * permanent hang.
 *
 * Test case: N/A — Charness has no Jira tracker.
