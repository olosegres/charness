/**
 * @description The voice handler must ENQUEUE the slow transcription job onto a
 * per-thread FIFO queue and RETURN immediately, so a slow Groq transcription
 * can never stall telegraf's update loop (which awaits every handler in a batch
 * before the next getUpdates). These tests pin the three load-bearing
 * properties of the queue registry `getVoiceTranscriptionQueue`:
 *
 *  1. enqueue returns BEFORE a slow job resolves (the non-block proof);
 *  2. two jobs on the SAME key run in arrival order;
 *  3. jobs on DIFFERENT keys are NOT serialized against each other (a slow job
 *     on key A does not delay a job on key B).
 *
 * The registry holds the new logic; processVoiceJob itself is bot-coupled and
 * exercised live (per the plan's on-host step), not here.
