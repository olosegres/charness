/**
 * @description Wiring guard — the free-form question-cancel path posts EXACTLY
 * ONE cancellation notice.
 *
 * Live report (json-stream Claude): typing a free-form message
 * while a question was pending surfaced THREE messages about the same thing:
 *   1. the question bubble relabelled to "❌ Question cancelled: <header>"
 *      (an in-place edit — `agent.question_cancelled_msg_label`),
 *   2. a SEPARATE "⚠️ Previous question cancelled — running your new request."
 *      line (`agent.question_cancelled_for_prompt`),
 *   3. a bogus "Claude error: API error" from the adapter (fixed separately in
 *      `claudeJsonStreamAdapter` — the interrupt-aborted turn is now swallowed).
 *
 * This guard locks the fix for (2): `cancelPendingQuestionAndForward` must post
 * the standalone notice ONLY when there was no question bubble to relabel
 * (`didLabelQuestionMessage`). When the bubble WAS relabelled, that relabel is
 * the single notice — a second standalone line is the reported noise.
 *
 * Structural (not behavioural): the function lives in the side-effecting
 * `bot.ts` and depends on Telegram I/O, so — like `voiceQuestionCancelWiring` —
 * the seam is asserted against the source. The cancel DECISION itself is pure
 * and covered in `openCodeQuestionFlow.test.ts` (`getQuestionReplyRoute`).
 *
 * No Jira test-case issue exists for this repo; recording the gap per
 * `tests.md` instead of inventing an id.
