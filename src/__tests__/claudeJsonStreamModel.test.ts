/**
 * @description The json-stream backend must be able to NAME the model it runs.
 * `/status` and the pinned banner read `getCurrentModel`, which used to return
 * only the explicit `--model` spawn pick — and that pick is `null` on every
 * default start, every resume, and every boot-time adopt, so a topic on the
 * default backend showed no model at all (user report 2026-08-23).
 *
 * Load-bearing intent (per `.claude/rules/tests.md`):
 * - claude's own `system/init` carries the RESOLVED model id and is the only
 *   report of the live model; driving a real init line through the adapter's
 *   stdout path must make `getCurrentModel` name it;
 * - the reported id must NOT leak into the re-spawn pick (`session.model`),
 *   which is replayed verbatim as `--model` on an effort/model re-spawn —
 *   overwriting it would silently pin a session that asked for no model to one
 *   frozen snapshot;
 * - the pick still answers during the window between a `/model` re-spawn and
 *   its first `init`, so the label never blanks out mid-switch.
 *
 * Private members are reached via runtime bracket access (tests are
 * type-stripped by tsx), same pattern as claudeJsonStreamWatermarkAdvance.
 *
 * Test case: N/A — Charness has no Jira tracker.
