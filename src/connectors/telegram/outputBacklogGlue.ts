/**
 * @description Pure backlog-glue for the per-topic send queue (S2b).
 *
 * When a topic BACKS UP — the global 1/2s send pacer (S1) leaves ≥3 messages
 * waiting to send for one topic — a per-2s trickle reads badly. This collapses
 * that backlog into ONE message (frames joined by a blank line, `\n\n`) so the
 * burst drains in a single send. 1–2 pending frames stay separate (snappy).
 *
 * The join+threshold is a pure, Telegraf-free helper (mirrors
 * `utils/outputFlushPlan.ts` / `utils/groupFinalizePlan.ts`): input = ordered
 * pending frames, output = the fewest messages that fit, each ≤ the cap, frames
 * joined by `\n\n`. Per-topic only — cross-topic messages carry distinct
 * `message_thread_id`s and can never merge, so "in one chat" ⇒ "in one topic's
 * queue".
 *
 * Splitting reuses {@link splitMessage}: it already emits the fewest chunks that
 * fit, preferring newline boundaries (so a glued block breaks on the `\n\n`
 * frame boundaries, never mid-line) and honouring the rendered-length cap when a
 * measure is supplied.
