/**
 * @description FIFO buffer for prompts typed while an agent session is still
 * starting up.
 *
 * Both backends have a startup window where the session is not yet ready to
 * receive input: Claude boots a tmux pane + `node-pty`, OpenCode boots the
 * local server and `POST /session`. A message typed during that window used to
 * be dropped — the bot saw `checkIsActive === false`, routed the text to the
 * "no agent running" guidance, and the user had to retype once the session was
 * up. This buffer captures those prompts and replays them, in arrival order,
 * the moment the session becomes active.
 *
 * Adapter-agnostic on purpose: the startup race is identical for Claude and
 * OpenCode, so the fix lives in the bot layer instead of being duplicated in
 * each adapter. Keyed by `keyToString(SessionKey)`.
