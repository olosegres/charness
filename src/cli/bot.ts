/**
 * @description Shared bot startup used by the public no-arg CLI and the
 * internal hot-worker entry.
 *
 * Responsibilities executed in order:
 *
 *   1. Load `.env` files (global, then local override — or ONLY `ENV_FILE`)
 *      between the connector guards, which exit on a breach. Must happen BEFORE
 *      the bot module is imported, because `src/bot.ts` reads many
 *      `process.env.*` values at top-level (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, WORK_ROOT,
 *      ALLOWED_GROUP_ID, etc.).
 *   2. Default `WORK_ROOT` to `process.cwd()` if still unset. This is the
 *      normal path: start `telegramcode` from the parent folder containing
 *      the projects/topics you want to bind.
 *   3. Validate `WORK_ROOT` resolves to an existing directory — fail fast
 *      with a clear message if not.
 *   4. Acquire the single-instance lock and wire cleanup handlers.
 *   5. Dynamically import `../bot` (which reads env at module scope) and
 *      call `startBot()`.
 *
 * The dynamic import in step 5 is deliberate: a static `import` at the top
 * of this file would resolve `process.env` at module-load time, before
 * the env load ran, and we'd see undefined tokens. `await import(...)`
 * defers binding until after env is populated.
