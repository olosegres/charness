/**
 * @description Ordered, deterministic graceful-shutdown sequence shared by
 * every signal-driven exit path (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) of the bot.
 *
 * **Why a dedicated module:**
 *
 *   - **Single owner of exit ordering.** The previous code had two SIGTERM
 *     handlers: `installLockCleanupHandlers()` (in `instanceLock.ts`) was
 *     registered first and called `releaseLock(); process.exit(0)` *synchronously*,
 *     pre-empting the bot's own async `state.flush()`. Frequent reloads
 *     under nodemon could therefore lose the last <500ms of state (one
 *     debounce window). The fix is to remove the lock module's signal
 *     handlers entirely and route every signal through this orchestrator,
 *     which awaits the flush before releasing the lock.
 *
 *   - **Bounded by a watchdog.** If `state.flush()` hangs (disk full,
 *     network FS that lost its mount), the sequence still terminates
 *     within {@link DEFAULT_WATCHDOG_MS} so the next nodemon respawn can
 *     reclaim the lock instead of waiting forever.
 *
 *   - **Testable.** Dependencies are injected, so a unit test can assert
 *     ordering (`state.flush()` resolves before `releaseLock()`) and
 *     watchdog behaviour without spinning up Telegram or the lockfile.
 *
 * **What it deliberately does NOT do:** stop tmux sessions or kill the
 * OpenCode HTTP server. Both run in external process groups and survive
 * the bot process by design — the reattach path on the next boot picks
 * them up. Killing them here would defeat the whole "hot reload keeps
 * agents alive" property the surrounding plan rests on.
 */

/**
 * @description Upper bound (ms) on the whole graceful-shutdown sequence — the
 * watchdog forces `releaseLock(); exit(0)` when it elapses first. Raised from
 * 3s when the sequence gained the bounded (≤~7s) output flush. Exported because
 * the lock module's same-token handoff wait must OUT-WAIT this window (the
 * incoming nodemon respawn polls the lock while the predecessor finishes
 * shutting down); an undersized wait aborts the new process and leaves the bot
 * down until the next file change.

/**
 * @description Run the ordered shutdown sequence:

 *   1a. `await finalizePendingOutput()` — flush the not-yet-delivered agent
 *      output (coalesce buffers / DM drafts → send FIFOs) while the Telegram
 *      client is still up, so a restart can't swallow it. Self-bounded.
 *   1b. `await clearTransientFrames()` — best-effort delete of the
 *      "✽ working…" / thinking / sub-agent status frames still on screen,
 *      while the Telegram client is still up. Self-bounded so it can't
 *      starve the flush.
 *   2. `bot.stop(signal)` — Telegraf stops long-polling. Synchronous in
 *      Telegraf 4.x, so safe to call before the flush.
 *   2b. `await drainPendingUpdates()` — drain the off-loop update queues so
 *      updates enqueued during a hot-reload still route to their live agent.
 *      Self-bounded, so it can't starve the flush's watchdog budget.
 *   3. `await state.flush()` — atomic-write any pending state changes.
 *      THIS is the step the old `releaseLock(); process.exit(0)` raced;
 *      we wait for the on-disk rename to land here.
 *   4. `releaseLock()` — drop the lockfile so the incoming nodemon
 *      respawn can claim it. Idempotent and owner-checked, so the
 *      `process.on('exit')` safety net in `lock.ts` finding nothing to do
 *      is fine.
 *   5. `exit(0)` — let Node tear the rest down.
 *
 * The watchdog races the whole sequence (steps 2-4): if it fires first,
 * we still call `releaseLock(); exit(0)` so the operator's terminal
 * unblocks and nodemon's next iteration finds a free lock.
