# Run as the checkout's OWNING user (interactively or from cron). Safe by
# construction: fast-forward only; skips silently when the tree has tracked
# changes, a merge/rebase is in progress, or local history diverged from the
# upstream (a dev clone that is ahead of origin is normal and is never touched).
#
# A hot-mode instance (`charness hot`: tsc -w + nodemon) picks the pulled
# source up automatically; a non-hot instance gets `yarn build` here plus a
# restart notice — this script never kills or restarts processes itself.
